## 2. Model Architectures

## 3. OpenPose

## 4. Action Recognition Models
We tried our best and took several videos for squat and plank, and then changed them into images as data input.

### Squat: 2659\
Correct: 1330 \
Incorrect: 1329\
### Plank: 5611\
Correct: 1736\
Incorrect (High-Hip): 1785\
Incorrect (Low-Hip): 2090\
